PART 1: SOLIDIFY TERMINOLOGY

1) HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and acts as the foundation of data communication in the World Wide Web, which 
   includes for example hypertext documents that include hyperlinks to other resources that a user can easily access.

2) URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and is a reference to a internet address for a web page or web site. It has 2 main
   components: the Protocol identifier (i.e. http) and the Resource name (i.e. google.com).

3) DNS stands for Domain Name System and acts like the phonebook of the internet. It turns domain names or websites into IP
   addresses so browsers can load internet resources. DNS servers eliminate the needfor humans to memorize IP address information.

4) A query string is part of a URL that assigns values to specified parameters to assist with storing data and always follows a "?"
   within the URL hyperlink.

5) - GET: gets some data from a server through search forms and other methods
   - POST: sends data to a server (i.e. web pages that change data on a server)

6) An HTTP request is a direct request from the client to a server, such as a browser sending a request to the server to return a
   response following HTTP protocols.

7) An HTTP response is made by a server to a client to provide it with the requested resource, or to provide information about the
   action being carried out, or finally to inform the client that there was an error during processing.

8) An HTTP header is a request or response display field that passes additional context and metadata about that request or response.
   Two examples of headers are shown below:

   - Request URL:                   https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLh7Kbw8KFAxWtRzABHSpsDBQQPAgJ
     Request Method:                GET
     Status Code:                   200 OK
     Remote Address:                74.125.138.147:443
     Referrer Policy:               origin

   - Request URL:                   https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLh7Kbw8KFAxWtRzABHSpsDBQQPAgJ&q=roll+a+die&csf
                                    =b&ct=ifl&cad=2:adventurous&ei=yTocZpDOOJOkkPIPn8uVkAs&ved=0ahUKEwjQ1q6AxMKFAxUTEkQIHZ9lBbIQnRsIHw&rct=j
     Request Method:                GET
     Status Code:                   200 OK
     Remote Address:                142.251.15.103:443
     Referrer Policy:               origin

9) First when the URL is typed, DNS converts it into an IP address. Then a client request is made including headers. The server than responds
   with a status code. The web page than loads the DOM with all of the resources necessary to include the HTML, CSS, and Javascript using individual
   HTTP requests and gets responses from the server for each of those resources being loaded.
